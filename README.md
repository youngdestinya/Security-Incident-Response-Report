# Security-Incident-Response-Report

Incident Summary: On January 23, 2021, at approximately 10:00 AM, in my role as the Senior IT Engineer (Cloud/Cybersecurity) for Oil and Gas Free Zones Authority, while conducting a routine security audit, I detected a cyber security incident involving a compromise of several email accounts. The attack was initiated through a phishing email that appeared to be from a trusted source. The email contained a malicious attachment that, when opened, installed malware on the user’s computer. The malware then allowed the attacker to gain access to the user’s email account.

Each aspect of the Incident Response Report is explained in detail in the attached file.
